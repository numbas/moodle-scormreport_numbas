# Numbas report for Moodle SCORM

This Moodle provides a special report for Moodle's SCORM player, for use with [Numbas](https:/www.numbas.org.uk) exams.

For each attempt, it shows the student's answers and scores against the correct answer for each part, in an easier to read form than Moodle's built-in "track details" view.

## Installation

Clone this repository into the folder `mod/scorm/report/numbas` inside your Moodle folder, then go to *Site administration → Notifications* and click to install it.

## Usage

Click on a Numbas SCORM package, then click *Reports → Numbas report*.

Click on the attempt number for the attempt you want to look at. You'll be shown a breakdown of the student's answers and scores for that attempt.
